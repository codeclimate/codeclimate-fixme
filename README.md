# FIXME Engine

`fixme` is that performs a case-sensitive search for the following strings in your project:

* `FIXME`
* `HACK`
* `BUG`
* `XXX`

These strings are things you should fix now, not later.

`fixme` is also very simple, and is intended to provide a `Hello World` like template. It is implemented in JavaScript as an NPM package.

# Code Climate FIXME CLI 

`codeclimate-fixme` is a CLI that performs a case-sensitive search for the following strings in your project:

* `TODO`
* `FIXME`
* `HACK`
* `BUG`
* `XXX`

These strings are things you should fix now, not later.

### Installation & Usage

1. `npm i codeclimate-fixme`
2. `fixme [table|json|sarif] [path]`

# Code Climate FIXME Engine

`codeclimate-fixme` is a Code Climate engine that performs a case-sensitive search for the following strings in your project:

* `TODO`
* `FIXME`
* `HACK`
* `BUG`
* `XXX`

These strings are things you should fix now, not later.

`codeclimate-fixme` is also very simple, and is intended to provide a `Hello World` like template for Code Climate Platform engine authors. It is implemented in JavaScript as an NPM package.

### Installation & Usage

1. If you haven't already, [install the Code Climate CLI](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate).
2. Run `codeclimate engines:install fixme`. This command both installs the engine and enables it in your `.codeclimate.yml` file.
3. You're ready to analyze! Browse into your project's folder and run `codeclimate analyze`.

### Configuration

You can specify what strings to match by adding a `strings` key in your
`.codeclimate.yml`:

```yaml
engines:
  fixme:
    enabled: true
    config:
      strings:
      - FIXME
      - CUSTOM
```

**NOTE**: values specified here *override* the defaults, they are not
*additional* strings to match.
